<h2>Aim of the Project</h2>
<p>
The aim of the project is to build a Machine Learning
Model to predict whether an owner will initiate an auto
insurance claim in the next year.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
The auto insurance industry is witnessing a paradigm shift. Since auto insurance is a
homogenous good (challenging to differentiate product A from product B), companies are
fighting a price war. On top of that, the distribution channel is shifting more from traditional
insurance brokers to online purchases, which means that the ability for companies to interact
through human touchpoints is limited, and customers should be quoted at a reasonable price.
A good price quote is one that makes the customer purchase the policy and helps the company
to increase the profits.
</p>
<p>
Also, the insurance premium is calculated based on more than 50+ parameters, which means
that traditional business analytics-based algorithms are now limited in their ability to
differentiate among customers based on subtle parameters.

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mQmgnQpTO5x9WjR26z4J5DL8GAXzSRA5/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank"><h6>Download Dataset here</h6></a>
<p>The project involves the use of a dataset with 600k training data and 57 features/data.</p>
<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<h5>The model shall mainly support the following use cases:</h5>
<ol>
<li><font color="voilet">Conquering Market Share: </font>Capture market share by lowering the prices of the premium
for the customers, who are least likely to claim.</li>
<li><font color="voilet">Risk Management: </font>Charge the right premium from the customer, who is likely to claim
insurance in the coming year</li>
<li><font color="voilet">Smooth Processing:</font> Reduce the complexity of pricing models, as with most transactions
happening online and with more customer attributes available (thanks to the internet
and social media), time is ripe to harness the power of data and build complex ML
models</li>

<li><font color="voilet">Increased Profits: </font>As per industry estimate 1% reduction in the claim can boost profit by
10%. So, through the ML model, we can identify and deny the insurance to the driver
who will make a claim. Thus, ensuring reduced claim outgo and increased profit.
Part of the model development is to identify and prioritize the above use cases</li>
<h2>Process Flow</h2>
<h5>The Machine Learning model mainly consist of two phases:</h5>
<ol>
<li><font color="voilet">EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):</font>
Analyze the datasets to summarize their main
characteristics (with visual methods). A statistical
model can be used, but primarily EDA will be used
for seeing what the data can tell us beyond the
formal modeling or hypothesis testing task.

<p>Following tasks can be performed as a part of EDA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling/Normalization</li>
<li>Fill the missing values</li>
<li>Feature selection & engineering</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>
<li><font color="voilet">Machine Learning Modelling:</font> After EDA, the modeling comes into the process. The process of training an ML model
involves providing an ML algorithm (that is, the learning algorithm) with training data
to train the model. The term “ML model” refers to the model artifact that is created by
the training process.
<p>
The training data must contain the correct answer, which is known as a target or
target attribute. The learning algorithm finds patterns in the training data that maps
the input data attributes to the target (the answer that you want to predict), and it
outputs an ML model that captures these patterns.
